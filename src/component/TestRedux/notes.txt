Application data flow

1. Initial setup
	a. create a store, using the root reducer function
	b. store calls the root reducer and saves the value returned as the inital state
	c. UI components access the current state of the redux store and use the data gotten to render, also subscribe to any future store updates so they 			know if state has changed

2. Updates:
	a. something happens in the app.
	b. The app code disptaches an action to the redux store in response to the chages
	c. the store runs the reducer function with the current action alongside the previous state and saves the return value as the new state
	d. store then notifies all UI components that are subscribed to updates
	e. each UI component checks for the parts of the updated state they need
	f. the data gotten from the updated state is then re-rendered on the screen for visual effects etc
