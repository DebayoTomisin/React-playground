Nothing to see here
Junior developer (at the time of pushing)  just exploring his way with all things react, redux and other technologies that could function alongside the beauty that is react.

Redux is really giving me a hard time mehn won't lie! but more time spent, less cloudy it becomes
So i tried a bunch of things, watch tutorials over and over again and my conclusion is simple.
I understand the general idea of Redux but i'll have to make do with copying the boiler plate setups for now


The Tabs folder in the component is an attempt to recreate what i built in the React projects repository only this time i'll be doing it with redux
Should be a fun ride.

Thank you!
